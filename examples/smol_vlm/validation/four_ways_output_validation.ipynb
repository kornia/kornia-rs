    "Life is characterized by certain key features that distinguish it from non-living matter. These features include the ability to grow, reproduce, respond to stimuli, and adapt to the environment. Life is also characterized by the presence of energy, which is necessary for all living organisms to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The origins of life are a topic of ongoing research, but it is believed that life first emerged on Earth approximately 3.8 billion years ago. The first living organisms were simple, single-celled organisms that were able to perform basic functions such as growth, reproduction, and metabolism. Over time, these organisms evolved into more complex forms, eventually leading to the diversity of life that we see today.\n",
